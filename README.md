# Student-Registration-Database
Second Project for CS 432 at Binghamton University

Project was to create a text based Java application using PL/SQL and JDBC that could support 
typical student registration tasks at a university. Tasks the application was required to support include:
  Add/delete students from database.
  Display contents of table selected by user
  List all classes taken by selected student
  List all prerequisites required by selected course
  List all students enrolled in selected class
  Enroll/drop selected student from a selected class
  Create a log everytime a student was added to/deleted from the system with generated log id and timestamp
